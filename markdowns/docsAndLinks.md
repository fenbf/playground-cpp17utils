## Documents & Links

Just to recall:

First of all, if you want to dig into the standard on your own, you can read the latest draft here:

[N4659, 2017-03-21, Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4659.pdf) - from [isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org/).

Also, you can grab my list of concise descriptions of all of the C++17 - It’s a one-page reference card, pdf language features: [grab it here](http://eepurl.com/cyycFz).
